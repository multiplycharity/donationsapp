<p class="pb-2 pt-2 font-semibold">Protection of personal data</p>
<p class="pb-2">Legislation requires your personal information to be kept secure and confidential. We store your personal information on servers with high levels of security, which are located in controlled facilities, and our security is checked regularly to determine whether our user information is handled securely and always taking your rights as a user into account. However, we cannot 100% guarantee security for data transmissions over the internet. This means that there may be a risk that other unauthorised parties gain access to information when data is sent and stored electronically. Thus, your personal information is submitted at your own risk. Personal information is deleted or made anonymous continuously as the purpose for which it was collected ends.</p>


<p class="pb-2 pt-2 font-semibold">Your information and the blockchain</p>
<p class="pb-2">Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply ‘DLT’), is at the core of our business. Blockchains are decentralized and made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called ‘blocks’. The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several ‘nodes’ which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.</p>

<p class="pb-2">Accordingly, by design, a blockchains records cannot be changed or deleted and is said to be ‘immutable’. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’), or your rights to object or restrict processing, of your personal data. Data on the blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.</p>

<p class="pb-2">In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of tokens) it will be necessary to write certain personal data, such as your Ethereum or other cryptocurrency wallet address, onto the blockchain; this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your wallet’s private key.</p>
<p class="pb-2">In most cases ultimate decisions to (i) transact on the blockchain using your Ethereum or other cryptocurrency wallet address, as well as (ii) share the public key relating to your Ethereum or other cryptocurrency wallet address with anyone (including us) rests with you.</p>
<p class="pb-2">IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN.IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE</p>

<p class="pb-2">The rapid development of the internet means that changes in our processing of personal data may be necessary. We thus reserve the right to update and amend these guidelines for the processing of personal data. If we do, we will of course correct the "last updated" date at the bottom of the page. In case of substantial changes, we will notify you in the form of a visible notice on our websites.</p>

<p class="pb-2 pt-2 font-semibold">Contact regarding personal data</p>


<p class="pb-2">If you want to access the information we hold about you, please contact us at: contact@multiply.charity</p>

<p class="pb-2">If incorrect data has been registered, or you have other objections, you can contact the same place. You can look at what information about you is registered and you can object to registration under the Personal Data Act. As a visitor, you are entitled to access your collected data categories and you may object to the registration pursuant to the relevant rules in the EU legislation General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Upon appropriate request, we will update, change or remove personal information that we control with reservation against violating any legislation.</p>

<p class="pb-2">We can reject requests that are unreasonable repeated, demand disproportional high technical intervention (e.g. development of a new system or changing existing process substantially), affect another individual's personal data, or requests that are extremely impractical (e.g. information from back-up systems). Any queries regarding this should be directed to customer service via email contact@multiply.charity.</p>
