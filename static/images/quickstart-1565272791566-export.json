      "description" : "In Kenya’s poor communities, residents have lots to sell - from home-grown tomatoes to their labor time or teaching children - but few people have enough cash to buy the goods and services, reducing the incentive to produce more. Barter works for some exchanges, but keeping track of who owes what is an inefficient process. The same goes for village savings and loans groups where transactions are commonly recorded on slips of paper and kept in a locked box.",

Implemented by Grassroots Economics, Sarafu builds on a rich history of community programs in Africa. The team already runs programs in 6 locations across Kenya and assists with 2 in South Africa, helping more than 1,000 small businesses and 20 schools to take an active role in their own economy and development.",
